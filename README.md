# My Deep Learning Journey

Welcome to **My Deep Learning Journey**! This repository documents my exploration, experiments, and projects as I learn about deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Here you’ll find notebooks, scripts, and resources covering fundamental concepts, practical applications, and personal projects.

## About

This repository serves as a personal log of my learning process in deep learning, with code examples, project notebooks, and notes. The aim is to deepen my understanding while sharing resources and insights that might help others on a similar path.

## Getting Started

To get started with the materials in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ritik-gupta001/My-Deep-Learning-Journey.git
   cd My-Deep-Learning-Journey
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Browse the notebooks and scripts** to start learning!
